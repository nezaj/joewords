I'm a big fan of [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/) (aka PG) and [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/). In 2011, I left my management consulting job to learn how to code. It was around this time I discovered PG, YC, and [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/). I knew I wanted to do my own startup, and PG's words resonated and inspired me.

When talking with others about starting a startup or doing YC, I often send PG essays. I've done this so many times that I realized I should just compile a list and share that. So here it is.

* [How To Do What You Love](http://paulgraham.com/love.html)
* [How To Make Wealth](http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html)
* [How To Start A Startup](http://paulgraham.com/start.html)
* [Ideas for Startups](http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html)
* [Startups in 13 Sentences](http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html)
* [What Startups Are Really Like](http://paulgraham.com/really.html)
* [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
* [Why YC](http://www.paulgraham.com/whyyc.html)

YC was a dream for me, and I'm grateful that I did it with my [best friend](https://stopa.io). I highly encourage folks to [apply](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/). Even if you're not thinking of doing the program, the application questions are good food for thought.
